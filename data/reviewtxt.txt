This person was a wonderful roommate. we had a great friendship going on and I wish I could room with him next year
I didn't like this person as a roommate. There were several things that irked me such as the constant throwing of candy wrappers on the floor.
She was an okay roommate. Nothing out of the ordinary. I wasn't particularly close with her, nor did we ever get into conflicts.
This is another review. 
10/10, I loved having this person as my roommate
